# About The Project

How it started:

I've always been interested in coding and decided to start my adventure in programming with Python after taking an intro course on the subject. I am currently a finance professional who enjoys analyzing the financials of companies and learning what makes them successful.  During the pandemic, I took the extra time I gained from being able to work from home to start a project that would bridge my interest in finance and coding. Voila! here it is.

# How it's going:

It's been a frustrating and yet satisfying journey so far but the more I learn the more I realize this may be a never-ending project, which I am ok with!  Currently the code I've made gives me a summary of key metrics that I find important to see if a company is worth pursuing more DD.  

As a Python-based environment, this project uses Python data libraries in Data Science (Pandas) and Data Acquisition (Beautiful Soup), and a wonderful third-party library called pandasgui.  This provides a GUI for pandas and is wonderful for anyone who works with dataframes.

This code grabs data from Yahoo Finance and I have recently came across some great APIs like Financial Modeling Prep, Alpha Vantage, and Quandl.  The only quirk I have with them is you are limited to the number of "calls" you can use a day. So, this code may change completely someday to incorporate these great APIs but time will tell.
